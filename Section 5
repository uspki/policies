5.	MANAGEMENT, OPERATIONAL, AND PHYSICAL CONTROLS
CA’s operating under this policy SHALL develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive security program designed to:
1.	Protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes;
2.	Protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes;
3.	Protect against unauthorized or unlawful access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of any Certificate Data or Certificate Management Processes;
4.	Protect against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, any Certificate Data or Certificate Management Processes; and
5.	Comply with all other security requirements applicable to the CA by law.
The Certificate Management Process MUST include:
1.	physical security and environmental controls;
2.	system integrity controls, including configuration management, integrity maintenance of trusted code, and malware detection/prevention;
3.	network security and firewall management, including port restrictions and IP address filtering;
4.	user management, separate trusted-role assignments, education, awareness, and training; and
5.	logical access controls, activity logging, and inactivity time-outs to provide individual accountability.
Each CA’s security program MUST include an annual Risk Assessment that:
1.	Identifies foreseeable internal and external threats that could result in unauthorized access, disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction of any Certificate Data or Certificate Management Processes;
2.	Assesses the likelihood and potential damage of these threats, taking into consideration the sensitivity of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes; and
3.	Assesses the sufficiency of the policies, procedures, information systems, technology, and other arrangements that the CA has in place to counter such threats.
Based on the Risk Assessment, the CA SHALL develop, implement, and maintain a security plan consisting of security procedures, measures, and products designed to achieve the objectives set forth above and to manage and control the risks identified during the Risk Assessment, commensurate with the sensitivity of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes. The security plan MUST include administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes. The security plan MUST also take into account then-available technology and the cost of implementing the specific measures, and SHALL implement a reasonable level of security appropriate to the harm that might result from a breach of security and the nature of the data to be protected.
5.1.	PHYSICAL SECURITY CONTROLS
CA equipment SHALL be protected from unauthorized access while the cryptographic module is installed and activated.  The CA SHALL implement physical access controls to reduce the risk of equipment tampering even when the cryptographic module is not installed and activated.  CA cryptographic tokens SHALL be protected against theft, loss, and unauthorized use.
All the physical control requirements specified below apply equally to the TLS Root CA and subordinate CAs, and any remote workstations used to administer the CAs, except where specifically noted.
5.1.1.	Site location and construction
The location and construction of the facility housing the CA equipment, as well as sites housing remote workstations used to administer the CAs, SHALL be consistent with facilities used to house high-value, sensitive information.  The site location and construction, when combined with other physical security protection mechanisms such as guards, high security locks, and intrusion sensors, SHALL provide robust protection against unauthorized access to the CA equipment and records.
5.1.2.	Physical access
At a minimum, the physical access controls for CA equipment and Certificate Status Authority (CSA) equipment, as well as remote workstations used to administer the CAs, SHALL—
•	Ensure that no unauthorized access to the hardware is permitted.
•	Ensure that all removable media and paper containing sensitive plain-text information is stored in secure containers.
•	Be manually or electronically monitored for unauthorized intrusion at all times.
•	Ensure an access log is maintained and inspected periodically.
•	Require two-person physical access control to both the cryptographic module and computer systems.
When not in use, removable cryptographic modules, activation information used to access or enable cryptographic modules, and CA equipment SHALL be placed in secure containers.  Activation data SHALL be either memorized or recorded and stored in a manner commensurate with the security afforded the cryptographic module, and SHALL not be stored with the cryptographic module or removable hardware associated with remote workstations used to administer the CA.
A security check of the facility housing the CA equipment or remote workstations used to administer the CAs SHALL occur if the facility is to be left unattended.  At a minimum, the check SHALL verify the following:
•	The equipment is in a state appropriate to the current mode of operation (e.g., that cryptographic modules are in place when “open,” and secured when “closed,” and for the CA, that all equipment other than the repository is shut down).
•	Any security containers are properly secured.
•	Physical security systems (e.g., door locks, vent covers) are functioning properly.
•	The area is secured against unauthorized access.
A person or group of persons SHALL be made explicitly responsible for making such checks.  When a group of persons is responsible, a log identifying the person performing a check at each instance SHALL be maintained.  If the facility is not continuously attended, the last person to depart SHALL initial a sign-out sheet that indicates the date and time and asserts that all necessary physical protection mechanisms are in place and activated.
RA equipment SHALL be protected from unauthorized access while the cryptographic module is installed and activated.  The RA SHALL implement physical access controls to reduce the risk of equipment tampering even when the cryptographic module is not installed and activated.  These security mechanisms SHALL be commensurate with the level of threat in the RA equipment environment.
5.1.3.	Power and air conditioning
The CA SHALL have backup capability sufficient to lock out input, finish any pending actions, and record the state of the equipment automatically before lack of power or air conditioning causes a shutdown.  The repositories (containing CA certificates and CRLs) SHALL be provided with uninterrupted power sufficient for a minimum of 6 hours operation in the absence of commercial power, to maintain availability and avoid denial of service.
5.1.4.	Water exposures
CA equipment SHALL be installed such that it is not in danger of exposure to water (e.g., on tables or elevated floors).
Potential water damage from fire prevention and protection measures (e.g., sprinkler systems) are excluded from this requirement.
5.1.5.	Fire prevention and protection
No Stipulation
5.1.6.	Media storage
Media SHALL be stored so as to protect them from accidental damage (e.g., water, fire, or electromagnetic) and unauthorized physical access.
5.1.7.	Waste disposal
Sensitive media and documentation that are no longer needed for operations SHALL be destroyed in a secure manner.  For example, sensitive paper documentation SHALL be shredded, burned, or otherwise rendered unrecoverable.
5.1.8.	Off‐site backup
Full system backups sufficient to recover from system failure SHALL be made on a periodic schedule.  Backups are to be performed and stored off-site not less than once per week.  At least one full backup copy SHALL be stored at an off-site location (separate from CA equipment).  Only the latest full backup need be retained.  The backup SHALL be stored at a site with physical and procedural controls commensurate to that of the operational CA.
5.2.	PROCEDURAL CONTROLS

5.3.7.	Independent Contractor Controls
Delegated Third Party personnel fulfilling trusted roles are subject to all personnel requirements stipulated in this policy.
The CA SHALL verify that the Delegated Third Party’s personnel involved in the issuance of a Certificate meet the training and skills requirements of Section 5.3.3 and the document retention and event logging requirements of Section 5.4.1.
5.3.8.	Documentation Supplied to Personnel
Documentation sufficient to define duties and procedures for each role SHALL be provided to the personnel filling that role. 
5.4.    AUDIT LOGGING PROCEDURES
Audit log files SHALL be generated for all events relating to the security of the CA, CSA and RA.  Where possible, the security audit logs SHALL be automatically collected.  Where this is not possible, a logbook, paper form, or other physical mechanism SHALL be used.  All security audit logs, both electronic and non-electronic, SHALL be retained and made available during compliance audits. 
5.4.1.  Types of Events Recorded
The CA and each Delegated Third Party SHALL record details of the actions taken to process a certificate request and to issue a Certificate, including all information generated and documentation received in connection with the certificate request; the time and date; and the personnel involved. The CA SHALL make these records available to its Qualified Auditor as proof of the CA’s compliance with these Requirements.
The CA SHALL record at least the following events:
1.	CA KEY LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT EVENTS, including:
a.	Key generation, backup, storage, recovery, archival, and destruction; and
b.	Cryptographic device lifecycle management events.
2.	CA AND SUBSCRIBER CERTIFICATE LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT EVENTS, including:

3.	Description of the entry.
5.4.2.	Frequency for Processing and Archiving Audit Logs
Review of the audit log SHALL be required at least once every two months.
Such reviews involve verifying that the log has not been tampered with and then briefly inspecting all log entries, with a more thorough investigation of any alerts or irregularities in the logs.  A statistically significant portion of the security audit data generated by the CA since the last review SHALL be examined.  This amount will be described in the CPS.
All significant events SHALL be explained in an audit log summary.  Actions taken as a result of these reviews SHALL be documented.
5.4.3.	Retention Period for Audit Logs
Audit logs SHALL be retained on-site until reviewed, in addition to being archived as described in section 5.5.  The individual who removes audit logs from the CA system SHALL be an official different from the individuals who, in combination, command the CA signature key. The CA SHALL make these audit logs available to its Qualified Auditor upon request.
5.4.4.	Protection of Audit Log
The security audit data SHALL not be open for reading or modification by any human, or by any automated process, other than those that perform security audit processing.  CA system configuration and procedures must be implemented together to ensure that only authorized people archive or delete security audit data.  Procedures must be implemented to protect archived data from deletion or destruction before the end of the security audit data retention period (note that deletion requires modification access).  Security audit data SHALL be moved to a safe, secure storage location separate from the location where the data was generated.
5.4.5.	Audit Log Backup Procedures
Audit logs and audit summaries SHALL be backed up at least monthly.  A copy of the audit log SHALL be sent off-site on a monthly basis.
5.4.6.	Audit Log Accumulation System (internal vs. external)
The audit log collection system may or may not be external to the CA system.  Automated audit processes SHALL be invoked at system or application startup, and cease only at system or application shutdown.  Audit collection systems SHALL be configured such that security audit data is protected against loss (e.g., overwriting or overflow of automated log files).  Should it become apparent that an automated audit system has failed, and the integrity of the system or confidentiality of the information protected by the system is at risk, operations SHALL be suspended until the problem has been remedied.
5.4.7.	Notification to Event‐Causing Subject
There is no requirement to notify a subject that an event was audited.  Real-time alerts are neither required nor prohibited by this policy.
5.4.8.	Vulnerability Assessments
Additionally, the CA’s security program MUST include an annual Risk Assessment that:
1.	Identifies foreseeable internal and external threats that could result in unauthorized access, disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction of any Certificate Data or Certificate Management Processes;
2.	Assesses the likelihood and potential damage of these threats, taking into consideration the sensitivity of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes; and
3.	Assesses the sufficiency of the policies, procedures, information systems, technology, and other arrangements that the CA has in place to counter such threats. [BR 16.2]

5.5.	RECORDS ARCHIVAL
CAs operating under this policy must follow either the General Records Schedules established by the National Archives and Records Administration or an agency-specific schedule as applicable.
5.5.1.	Types of Records Archived
CA archive records SHALL be sufficiently detailed to determine the proper operation of the CA and the validity of any certificate (including those revoked or expired) issued by the CA.  At a minimum, the following data SHALL be recorded for archive:
•	CA accreditation (if applicable)
•	Certificate policy
•	Certification practice statement
•	Contractual obligations and other agreements concerning operations of the CA
•	System and equipment configuration
•	Modifications and updates to system or configuration
•	Certificate requests
•	All certificates issued and/or published
•	Record of re-key
•	Revocation requests
•	Subscriber identity authentication data 
•	Documentation of receipt and acceptance of certificates (if applicable)
•	Subscriber agreements
•	Documentation of receipt of tokens
•	All CRLs issued and/or published
•	Other data or applications to verify archive contents
•	Compliance Auditor reports
•	Any changes to the Audit parameters, e.g. audit frequency, type of event audited
•	Any attempt to delete or modify the Audit logs
•	Whenever the CA generates a key (Not mandatory for single session or one-time use symmetric keys)
•	All changes to the trusted public keys, including additions and deletions
•	The export of private and secret keys (keys used for a single session or message are excluded)
•	The approval or rejection of a certificate status change request
•	Appointment of an individual to a Trusted Role
•	Destruction of cryptographic modules
•	All certificate compromise notifications

•	Violations of Certificate Policy
•	Violations of Certification Practice Statement
5.5.2.	Retention Period for Archive
The CA SHALL retain all documentation relating to certificate requests and the verification thereof, and all Certificates and revocation thereof, for a minimum of 10 years and 6 months without any loss of data after any Certificate based on that documentation ceases to be valid

5.5.3.	Protection of Archive
No unauthorized user SHALL be permitted to write to, modify, or delete the archive.  For the CA, archived records may be moved to another medium.  The contents of the archive SHALL not be released except in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (as amended) and applicable Agency policies.  Records of individual transactions may be released upon request of any subscribers involved in the transaction or their legally recognized agents.  Archive media SHALL be stored in a safe, secure storage facility separate from the CA.
If the original media cannot retain the data for the required period, a mechanism to periodically transfer the archived data to new media SHALL be defined by the archive site. 
Alternatively, a CA operating under this policy may retain data using whatever procedures have been approved by NARA for that category of documents.  Applications required to process the archive data SHALL be maintained for a period that equals or exceeds the archive requirements for the data.
5.5.4.	Archive Backup Procedures
No Stipulation
5.5.5.	Requirements for Time‐stamping of Records
CA archive records SHALL be automatically time-stamped as they are created.  The system clocks used for time-stamping SHALL be maintained in synchrony with an authoritative time standard.
5.5.6.	Archive Collection System (internal or external)
Archive data may be collected in any expedient manner.
5.5.7.	Procedures to Obtain and Verify Archive Information
Procedures, detailing how to create, verify, package, transmit, and store the CA archive information, SHALL be published in the CPS.
5.6.	KEY CHANGEOVER
To minimize risk from compromise of a CA’s private signing key, that key may be changed often.  From that time on, only the new key will be used to sign CA and subscriber certificates.  If the old private key is used to sign OCSP responder certificates or CRLs that cover certificates signed with that key, the old key must be retained and protected.
After a CA performs a Key Changeover, the CA may continue to issue CRLs with the old key until all certificates signed with that key have expired. As an alternative, after all certificates signed with that old key have been revoked, the CA may issue a final long-term CRL using the old key, with a nextUpdate time past the validity period of all issued certificates. This final CRL SHALL be available for all relying parties until the validity period of all issued certificates has passed.  Once the last CRL has been issued, the old private signing key of the CA may be destroyed.
When a CA updates its private signature key and thus generates a new public key, the CA SHALL notify all CAs, RAs, and subscribers that rely on the CA’s certificate that it has been changed.  
5.7.	COMPROMISE AND DISASTER RECOVERY
5.7.1.	Incident and Compromise Handling Procedures
CA organizations SHALL have an Incident Response Plan and a Disaster Recovery Plan.
The CA SHALL document a business continuity and disaster recovery procedures designed to notify and reasonably protect Application Software Suppliers, Subscribers, and Relying Parties in the event of a disaster, security compromise, or business failure. The CA is not required to publicly disclose its business continuity plans but SHALL make its business continuity plan and security plans available to the CA’s auditors upon request. The CA SHALL annually test, review, and update these procedures.
The business continuity plan MUST include:
1.	The conditions for activating the plan,
2.	Emergency procedures,
3.	Fallback procedures,
4.	Resumption procedures,
5.	A maintenance schedule for the plan;
6.	Awareness and education requirements;
7.	The responsibilities of the individuals;
8.	Recovery time objective (RTO);
9.	Regular testing of contingency plans.
10.	The CA’s plan to maintain or restore the CA’s business operations in a timely manner following interruption to or failure of critical business processes
11.	A requirement to store critical cryptographic materials (i.e., secure cryptographic device and activation materials) at an alternate location;
12.	What constitutes an acceptable system outage and recovery time
13.	How frequently backup copies of essential business information and software are taken;
14.	The distance of recovery facilities to the CA’s main site; and
15.	Procedures for securing its facility to the extent possible during the period of time following a disaster and prior to restoring a secure environment either at the original or a remote site.
5.7.2.	Recovery Procedures if Computing Resources, Software, and/or Data Are Corrupted
When computing resources, software, and/or data are corrupted, CAs operating under this policy SHALL respond as follows:
•	Before returning to operation, ensure that the system’s integrity has been restored.
•	If the CA signature keys are not destroyed, CA operation SHALL be reestablished, giving priority to the ability to generate certificate status information within the CRL issuance schedule.
•	If the CA signature keys are destroyed, CA operation SHALL be reestablished as quickly as possible, giving priority to the generation of a new CA key pair.
5.7.3.	Recovery Procedures After Key Compromise
In the event of a CA private key compromise, the following operations must be performed.
•	The FPKIPA SHALL be immediately informed, as well as any superior or cross-certified CAs and any entities known to be distributing the CA certificate (e.g., in a root store).
•	The CA must generate new keys.
If the CA distributed the private key in a Trusted Certificate, the CA SHALL perform the following operations:
•	Generate a new Trusted Certificate.
•	Securely distribute the new Trusted Certificate 
•	Initiate procedures to notify subscribers of the compromise.
Subscriber certificates may be renewed automatically by the CA under the new key pair, or the CA may require subscribers to repeat the initial certificate application process.
5.7.4.	Business Continuity Capabilities after a Disaster
For the TLS Root CA, recovery procedures SHALL be in place to reconstitute the CA within six (6) hours of failure.
All other CAs operating under this policy SHALL have recovery procedures in place to reconstitute the CA within 72 hours of failure.
In the case of a disaster whereby the CA installation is physically damaged and all copies of the CA signature key are destroyed as a result, the FPKIPA SHALL be notified at the earliest feasible time, and the FPKIPA SHALL take whatever action it deems appropriate.
Relying parties may decide of their own volition whether to continue to use certificates signed with the destroyed private key pending reestablishment of CA operation with new certificates.
5.8.	CA OR RA TERMINATION
When a CA operating under this policy terminates operations before all certificates have expired, the CA signing keys SHALL be surrendered to the FPKIPA. 
This section does not apply to CAs that have ceased issuing new certificates but are continuing to issue CRLs until all certificates have expired.  Such CAs are required to continue to conform with all relevant aspects of this policy (e.g., audit logging and archives).
Any issued certificates that have not expired, SHALL be revoked and a final long term CRL with a nextUpdate time past the validity period of all issued certificates SHALL be generated.  This final CRL SHALL be available for all relying parties until the validity period of all issued certificates has passed.  Once the last CRL has been issued, the private signing key(s) of the CA to be terminated will be destroyed.
Prior to CA termination, the CA SHALL provide archived data to an archive facility.  As soon as possible, the CA will advise all other organizations to which it has issued certificates of its termination.
