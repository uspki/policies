            <p>Financial contributions to recognized disaster relief organizations are the fastest, most flexible and most effective method of donating. Organizations on the ground know what items and quantities are needed, often buy in bulk with discounts and, if possible, purchase through businesses local to the disaster, which supports economic recovery.</p>

            <p>On sunny days, open your curtains to allow the sun to naturally warm the rooms of your home without using electricity. Natural sunlight can also lift your mood to help brighten your day. On warm days, close your curtains to help keep your house cool.</p>

            <p>Instead of running high-energy-use appliances such as dishwashers and clothes dryers during mid-afternoon or early evening hours, operate them early in the morning or late at night. Some utilities charge less at off-peak times, which will help reduce your costs.</p>

            <p>Wash full loads, whether it’s clothes or dishes. Washing multiple small loads means you’re using and heating more water, which can increase your expenses. Using cold water for clothes washing can also help lower your costs.</p>
