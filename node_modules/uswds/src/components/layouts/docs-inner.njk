        <h1>Page heading (h1)</h1>

        <p class="usa-intro">The page heading communicates the main focus of the page. Make your page heading descriptive and keep it succinct.</p>

        <h2 id="section-heading-h2">Section heading (h2)</h2>

        <p>These headings introduce, respectively, sections and subsections within your body copy. As you create these headings, follow the same guidelines that you use when writing section headings: Be succinct, descriptive, and precise.</p>

        <h3 id="section-heading-h3">Subsection heading (h3)</h3>

        <p>The particulars of your body copy will be determined by the topic of your page. Regardless of topic, it’s a good practice to follow the inverted pyramid structure when writing copy: Begin with the information that’s most important to your users and then present information of less importance.</p>

        <p>Keep each section and subsection focused — a good approach is to include one theme (topic) per section.</p>

        <h4 id="section-heading-h4">Subsection heading (h4)</h4>

        <p>Use the side navigation menu to help your users quickly skip to different sections of your page. The menu is best suited to displaying a hierarchy with one to three levels and, as we mentioned, to display the sub-navigation of a given page.</p>
