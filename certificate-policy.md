# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Overview
This Certificate Policy (CP) outlines the policy and requirements for the U.S. Federal Public Key Infrastructure, and the issuance and management of U.S. Federal Publicly Trusted Device Certificates.  The certificates under this policy are for identifying and authenticating government services. This policy incorporates Certificate Transparency as a key component in promoting publicly accessible and accountable services.  

This document serves two purposes:  

- to specify the Federal Public Device PKI Certificate Policy and requirements, and
- to provide requirements for what each Certification Authority must address in its Certification Practice Statement

This policy is for a hierarchical Public Key Infrastructure restricted to services operated by or on behalf of the U.S. Government and U.S. Federal entities.  The hierarchical PKI is referenced as the **Federal Public Device PKI** in this document.  

This policy and requirements are applicable to all Certification Authorities within a chain of trust under the **US Federal Device Root CA**.  The requirements are to be flowed down from the Root Certification Authority through all Subordinate Certification Authorities.  

The Federal Public Device PKI conforms to the Version 1.4.9 of the guidelines adopted by the Certification Authority/Browser Forum (“CA/Browser Forum”) when issuing publicly trusted certificates, including the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly Trusted Certificates (“Baseline Requirements”). This document is based on the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements, which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. All additions and modifications made to create this document are in the public domain as works of the U.S. Government, and copyright and related rights in the work are waived.

Additional documents related to the Federal Public Device PKI, such as Certification Practice Statements, Audits, and Subscriber Agreement(s) can be found at \<INSERT URL HERE>.

In accordance with RFC 3647, this CP includes all nine sections of the RFC 3647 framework and an additional addendum with the certificate profiles.    

The terms and provisions of this certificate policy shall be interpreted under and governed by applicable Federal law.

The following Certification Authorities are covered under this CP:

| **CA Type** | **Distinguished Name** | **Key Pair Type and Parameters** | **SHA-256 Key Fingerprint** | **Validity Period** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Root CA | \<INSERT DN> | \<INSERT RSA> | \<INSERT SHA-256 FINGERPRINT> | \<INSERT VALIDITY PERIOD> |

## 1.3 PKI Participants
The Federal Public Key Infrastructure Policy Authority (FPKIPA) is a sub-council comprised of U.S. Federal Government Agency representatives and is chartered by the U.S. Federal CIO Council.  The FPKIPA manages this policy and represents the interests of the  U.S. Federal CIOs and CISOs.

### 1.3.1 Certification Authorities
The Certification Authorities operated under this policy provide services to U.S. Federal Government entities which may be part of the Executive Branch, Legislative Branch and Judicial Branch of the Federal Government. The services are not provided to the general public, commercial entities, U.S. State, Local, Territorial, Native Sovereign Nations, or international government entities.

Certification Authority (CA) is defined in Section 1.6.

### 1.3.2 Registration Authorities
This Certificate Policy is focused on promoting automation, improving efficiencies, supporting operational security, and establishing trust in the U.S. Government and the digital services operated by or on behalf of U.S. Federal Government entities.  The widespread adoption of practices and protocols to support automation in certificate management have been foundational to increases in the deployment of secure protocols for webservices.

While this policy promotes automation for the Certification Authorities, there still exists a need to allow a delegation of responsibility to U.S. Federal Government entities that form part of the U.S. Federal Government enterprise.  

This policy allows for persons who may not be affiliated with the same organizational unit that is operating the Certification Authority to assist in the certificate application process and be designated as Enterprise Registration Authorities as a role.  Registration Authority system functions shall be the responsibility of the Certification Authority.

A CA MAY designate an Enterprise Registration Authority (RA) to verify certificate requests from the Enterprise RA's affiliated U.S. Federal Government entity.  The CA SHALL NOT accept certificate requests authorized by an Enterprise RA unless the following requirements are satisfied:

1. The CA SHALL confirm that the requested Fully-Qualified Domain Name(s) are within the Enterprise RA's verified Domain Namespace(s) as registered in the .GOV (DotGov) and .MIL (DotMil) gTLDs Domain Name Registrars.  
2. The CA SHOULD confirm that the requested Fully-Qualified Domain Name(s) are not within any Domain Namespace(s) for any U.S. State, Local, Territorial, Native Sovereign Nations, or any other entities identified as a _Non-Federal Agency_ in the DotGov Domain Name Registrar per United States Code (U.S.C.) 41 CFR Part 102-173.

The CA SHALL impose these limitations through an agreement with the Authorizing Authority of the Domain Name as defined under United States Code (U.S.C.) 41 CFR Part 102-173. The CA SHALL monitor compliance by the Enterprise RA and institute technical controls.  The CA SHOULD use both audits and analytics based methods such as monitoring of Certificate Transparency Log(s) and services to ensure compliance.

Delegated Third Parties are not allowed under this policy.

### 1.3.3 Subscribers
As defined in Section 1.6.1.

### 1.3.4 Relying Parties
"Relying Party" and "Application Software Supplier" are defined in Section 1.6.1.

Relying Parties should verify the validity of certificates via revocation services provided for all certificates prior to relying on certificates. Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and On-line Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) service location information is provided within certificates.

### 1.3.5 Other Participants
Not applicable.


## 1.4 Certificate Usage

### 1.4.1 Appropriate Certificate Uses
This Certificate Policy (CP) and requirements for U.S. Federal Government is limited to Publicly Trusted Device Certificates used for identifying and authenticating devices and services.  Certificates may be used for all legal authentication and encryption purposes.

## 1.4.2 Prohibited Certificate Uses
Certificates may not be used where prohibited by law.   

Certificates for identifying natural persons are not allowed under this policy and the Federal Public Device PKI, including but not limited to identity certificates used to identify natural persons for digital signatures, S/MIME, client authentication, and encryption.  CAs may not issue Subscriber certificates for natural persons or enter into any cross-certification with any CAs that issue certificates used to identify and authenticate natural persons.  

## 1.5 Policy administration
The Federal Public Key Infrastructure Policy Authority (FPKIPA) manages this policy and represents the interests of the U.S. Federal CIOs and CISOs.   

### 1.5.1 Organization Administering the Document
The Federal Public Key Infrastructure Policy Authority (FPKIPA) is responsible for:  
* Maintaining this CP, and
* Approving the CPS for each CA that issues certificates under this policy, and
* Approving the compliance audit report for each CA issuing certificates under this policy, and
* Ensuring continued conformance of each CA that issues certificates under this policy with applicable requirements as a condition for allowing continued participation, and

# 3. IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

## 3.1 Naming

### 3.1.1 Types of names
This policy restricts the subject names of CAs.  CAs that issue certificates under this policy SHALL have distinguished names using geo-political names consisting of country, organization, and common name.  Organization units may only be used with approval by the Policy Authority.   

Subscriber certificates issued under this policy SHALL use distinguished names and subject alternative names that comply with Section 7.1.4, and the certificate profiles.

### 3.1.2 Need for names to be meaningful
No stipulation.

### 3.1.3 Anonymity or pseudonymity of subscribers
Subscribers are not identified in Domain Validation certificates. Only the country (US) and domain name is included in the subject information.

Subscribers are partially identified in Organizational Validation certificates.  The organization and location of the U.S. Government are included in the subject information. All Organizational Validation certificates only include an organization of U.S. Government and no additional organizational unit information.

Relying parties should consider certificates to be issued by the U.S. Government for U.S. Government assets and all Subscribers to be affiliated with the U.S. Government.  

### 3.1.4 Rules for interpreting various name forms
Distinguished names in certificates are interpreted using the X.500 Standard and the ASN.1 syntax.

The subject name in CA certificates SHALL match the issuer name in certificates issued by the subject, as required by RFC 5280.

### 3.1.5 Uniqueness of names
The common name attribute for Root CA(s) SHALL be unique.
The common name attribute for Subordinate CAs SHALL be unique from all other Subordinate CAs.

### 3.1.6 Recognition, authentication, and role of trademarks
CAs operating under this policy shall not issue a certificate that knowingly infringes any trademark.

The Policy Authority shall resolve disputes involving names and trademarks.

## 3.2 Initial identity validation

### 3.2.1 Method to prove possession of private key
Issuing CA's SHALL describe the method(s) used to prove possession of private keys in the Certification Practice Statement(s).

Example: The CA verifies the digital signature on a signed object.  The signed object is a PKCS#10 certification signing request.

### 3.2.2 Authentication of Organization and Domain Identity

All Domain Validation certificates issued under this Certificate Policy MAY include Subject Identity Information of countryName and SHALL NOT include any other Subject Identity Information with the exception of the required Common Name. If the Applicant requests a Domain Validation Certificate that will contain Subject Identity Information to include the the countryName field, then the CA SHALL verify the country associated with the Subject using a verification process meeting the requirements of Section 3.2.2.3.

All Organization Validation certificates issued under this Certificate Policy SHALL include Subject Identity Information of countryName **and** Organization **and** State and SHALL NOT include any other Subject Identity Information with the exception of the required Common Name.  If the Applicant requests a Certificate that will contain Subject Identity Information comprised of the countryName field and Organization and State, then the CA SHALL verify the identity of the Applicant, and the authenticity of the Applicant Representative's certificate request using a verification process meeting the requirements Section 3.2.2.1.  

Issuing CA's SHALL describe these verification processes in the Certification Practice Statement(s).

The CA SHALL inspect any document relied upon under this Section for alteration or falsification.

#### 3.2.2.1 Identity
Any Organization Validation certificates issued under this Certificate Policy are for U.S. Government mission purposes and for consumers, partners, and other relying parties to identify the U.S. as the subject.  All Organization Validation certificates SHALL include Subject Identity Information of countryName **and** Organization **and** State and SHALL NOT include any other Subject Identity Information with the exception of the required Common Name.  See Section 7.1.4.2.2.

If the Subject Identity Information is to include the name of our organization (o=U.S. Government), the CA SHALL verify the identity and address of the organization and that the address is the Applicant's address of existence or operation.  Asserting U.S. Government as the organization SHALL be verified by the CA using documentation provided by, or through communication with, at least one of the following:

1. A government agency in the jurisdiction of the Applicant's legal creation, existence, or recognition;
2. A third party database that is periodically updated and considered a Reliable Data Source such as the DotGov and DotMil Domain Name Registrars;
3. \<not allowed>
4. An Attestation Letter.

The CA MAY use the same documentation or communication described in 1 through 4 above to verify both the Applicant's identity and address.

_Practice Note:_ U.S. Government entities are in the jurisdiction of the U.S. Government.   Verification of the domain to be part of the U.S. Government as the top level organization (o=U.S. Government) SHOULD suffice to assert the U.S. Government primary headquarter locations for address.  This Certificate Policy relies upon the establishment of three branches of the U.S. Government as defined in the U.S. Constitution.  All three branches of the U.S. Government have primary headquarters located in the city of Washington in the District of Columbia in the United States of America. _End Practice Note_

#### 3.2.2.2 DBA/Tradename
Subject Identity Information SHALL NOT include a DBA or tradename.


#### 3.2.2.3 Verification of Country
This Certificate Policy is restricted to the gTLDs for DotGov and DotMil, registered as the sub-category of _sponsored_ TLDs (sTLDs) with ICANN.  

DotGov is sponsored by the U.S. Government's General Services Administration.  DotGov regulations are defined in 41 CFR Part 102-173. Under 41 CFR Part 102-173.30, registration in the DotGov domain is only available to official governmental organizations in the United States including Federal, State and local governments, and Native Sovereign Nations.  

DotMil is sponsored by the U.S. Government's Department of Defense.  The DotMil domain exists for the exclusive use of the Department of Defense and is referenced in Department of Defense Issuances Informational (DoDI) 8410.   

The Domain Name Registrars for both DotGov and DotMil are managed by the U.S. Government.

This Certificate Policy asserts for all Certification Authorities operating under this policy that the inclusion of subject:countryName in any Subscriber certificate is verified by:

- Section 3.2.2.3 of the CA/B Forum Baseline Requirements, option (c): information provided by the Domain Name Registrar
- Section 3.2.2.3 of the CA/B Forum Baseline Requirements, option (b): the ccTLD of the requested Domain Name.  This CP asserts comparable controls for the sTLDs operated by the U.S. Government.  

Issuing CA's SHALL describe these verification processes in the Certification Practice Statement(s).

#### 3.2.2.4 Validation of Domain Authorization or Control

##### 3.2.2.4.5 Domain Authorization Document

Confirming the Applicant's control over the requested FQDN by relying upon the attestation to the authority of the Applicant to request a Certificate contained in a Domain Authorization Document. The Domain Authorization Document SHALL substantiate that the communication came from the Domain Contact. The CA SHALL verify that the Domain Authorization Document was either (i) dated on or after the date of the domain validation request or (ii) that the WHOIS data has not materially changed since a previously provided Domain Authorization Document for the Domain Name Space.

##### 3.2.2.4.6 Agreed-Upon Change to Website

Confirming the Applicant's control over the requested FQDN by confirming one of the following under the "/.well-known/pki-validation" directory, or another path registered with IANA for the purpose of Domain Validation, on the Authorization Domain Name that is accessible by the CA via HTTP/HTTPS over an Authorized Port:  

1.  The presence of Required Website Content contained in the content of a file or on a web page in the form of a meta tag. The entire Required Website Content MUST NOT appear in the request used to retrieve the file or web page, or  
2.  The presence of the Request Token or Request Value contained in the content of a file or on a webpage in the form of a meta tag where the Request Token or Random Value MUST NOT appear in the request.  

If a Random Value is used, the CA SHALL provide a Random Value unique to the certificate request and SHALL not use the Random Value after 30 days.

Note: Examples of Request Tokens include, but are not limited to: (i) a hash of the public key; (ii) a hash of the Subject Public Key Info [X.509]; and (iii) a hash of a PKCS#10 CSR. A Request Token may also be concatenated with a timestamp or other data.

The CA SHALL define in its CPS the format of Request Tokens it accepts and SHALL document the "/.well-known/pki-validation/" directory and any other paths registered with IANA.

#### 3.2.2.5 Authentication for an IP Address
Not allowed as of the Effective Date of this Certificate Policy. IP Addresses are not allowed in the certificate profiles under this Certificate Policy.


#### 3.2.2.6 Wildcard Domain Validation
Before issuing a certificate with a wildcard character (\*) in a CN or subjectAltName, the CA SHALL establish and follow a documented procedure and technical controls that determines if the wildcard character occurs in the first label position to the left of the DotGov and DotMil suffixes (e.g. \*.gov, \*.mil). If a wildcard would fall within the label immediately to the left of the DotGov and DotMil suffixes (e.g. \*.gov, \*.mil), CAs SHALL refuse issuance.  All CAs are prohibited from issuing any Wildcard Certificate to the entire gTLDs for DotGov and / or DotMil.

Wildcard certificates are not allowed to be validated using 3.2.2.4.6 or 3.2.2.4.10.  All wildcard certificates SHALL require a Domain Authorization Document (3.2.2.4.5) by the Domain Contact authorizing the issuing of a certificate that includes a wildcard domain.  

#### 3.2.2.7 Data Source Accuracy
Prior to using any data source as a Reliable Data Source, the CA SHALL evaluate the source for its reliability, accuracy, and resistance to alteration or falsification. The CA SHOULD consider the following during its evaluation:

1. The age of the information provided,
2. The frequency of updates to the information source,
3. The data provider and purpose of the data collection,
4. The public accessibility of the data availability, and
5. The relative difficulty in falsifying or altering the data.

Databases maintained by the CA or affiliated government agencies do not qualify as a Reliable Data Source if the primary purpose of the database is to collect information for the purpose of fulfilling the validation requirements under this Section 3.2.

#### 3.2.2.8 CAA Records
When processing CAA records, CAs SHALL process the issue, issuewild, and iodef property tags as specified in RFC 6844, although they are not required to act on the contents of the iodef property tag. Additional property tags MAY be supported, but SHALL NOT conflict with or supersede the mandatory property tags set out in this document. CAs SHALL respect the critical flag and not issue a certificate if they encounter an unrecognized property with this flag set.

RFC 6844 requires that CAs “MUST NOT issue a certificate unless either (1) the certificate request is consistent with the applicable CAA Resource Record set or (2) an exception specified in the relevant Certification Practice Statement applies.”

For issuances conforming to this Certificate Policy, CAs SHALL NOT rely on any exceptions specified in their respective CPS unless they are one of the following:  
-  CAA checking is optional for certificates for which a Certificate Transparency pre-certificate was created and logged in at least two public logs, and for which CAA was checked.
-  CAA checking is optional if the CA or an Affiliate of the CA is the DNS Operator (as defined in RFC 7719) of the domain’s DNS.  

CAs are permitted to treat a record lookup failure as permission to issue if:  
-  the failure is outside the CA’s infrastructure;
-  the lookup has been retried at least once; and
-  the domain’s zone does not have a DNSSEC validation chain to the ICANN root.  

CAs SHALL document potential issuances that were prevented by a CAA record in sufficient detail to provide feedback on the circumstances, and SHOULD dispatch reports of such issuance requests to the contact(s) stipulated in the CAA iodef record(s), if present. CAs are not expected to support URL schemes in the iodef record other than mailto: or https:.

### 3.2.3 Authentication of individual identity
Subscriber certificates identifying and authenticating natural born persons or individual identity SHALL NOT be issued under this policy.  

### 3.2.4 Non-verified subscriber information
Non-verified subscriber information SHALL NOT be asserted in any certificates under this Certificate Policy.

If the Applicant for a Certificate containing Subject Identity Information is an organization, the CA SHALL use a Reliable Method of Communication to verify the authenticity of the Applicant Representative's certificate request.

The CA MAY use the sources listed in section 3.2.2.1 to verify the Reliable Method of Communication. Provided that the CA uses a Reliable Method of Communication, the CA MAY establish the authenticity of the certificate request directly with the Applicant Representative or with an authoritative source within the Applicant's organization, such as the Applicant's main business offices,  human resource offices, information technology offices, or other division that the CA deems appropriate.

In addition, the CA SHALL establish a process that allows an Applicant to specify the individuals who may request Certificates. If an Applicant specifies, in writing, the individuals who may request a Certificate, then the CA SHALL NOT accept any certificate requests that are outside this specification. The CA SHALL provide an Applicant with a list of its authorized certificate requesters upon the Applicant's verified written request.

### 3.2.6 Criteria for Interoperation or Certification
CAs SHALL NOT have Cross Certificate(s) that identify the CA as the Subject without explicit written permission of the Policy Authority.  Any Cross Certificates SHALL be disclosed publicly, submitted to one or more Certificate Transparency Logs, published to the Repository, and identified in the update to the CPS.

## 3.3 Identification and authentication for re-key requests

The Subscriber, RA, or Issuing CA can initiate revocation. Additionally, Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software Suppliers, and other third parties may submit Certificate Problem Reports informing the issuing CA of reasonable cause to revoke the certificate.

The Policy Authority SHALL direct any revocation of a CA certificate.

### 4.9.3 Procedure for revocation request
The CA SHALL provide a process for Subscribers to request revocation of their own Certificates. The process SHALL be described in the CA's Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement. The CA SHALL maintain a continuous 24x7 ability to accept and respond to revocation requests and related inquiries.

The CA SHALL provide Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software Suppliers, and other third parties with clear instructions for reporting suspected Private Key Compromise, Certificate misuse, or other types of fraud, compromise, misuse, inappropriate conduct, or any other matter related to Certificates. The CA SHALL publicly disclose the instructions through a readily accessible online means.

A request to revoke a certificate shall identify the certificate to be revoked, explain the reason for revocation, and allow the request to be authenticated (e.g., digitally or manually signed).

### 4.9.4 Revocation request grace period
There is no revocation grace period.

### 4.9.5 Time within which CA must process the revocation request
The CA SHALL begin investigation of a of a Request for Revocation or a Certificate Problem Report immediately upon receipt, and decide whether revocation or other appropriate action is warranted based on at least the following criteria:

1. The nature of the alleged problem;
2. The number of Certificate Problem Reports received about a particular Certificate or Subscriber;
3. The entity making the complaint (for example, a complaint from a law enforcement Office of the Inspector General (OIG) official that a Web site violates Federal regulation should carry more weight than a complaint from a user alleging that they were unable to complete their transaction); and
4. Relevant legislation.

### 4.9.6 Revocation checking requirement for relying parties
No stipulation.

(Note: Following certificate issuance, a certificate may be revoked for reasons stated in Section 4.9.1. Therefore, relying parties should check the revocation status of all certificates that contain a CDP or OCSP pointer.)

### 4.9.7 CRL issuance frequency

For the status of Subscriber Certificates:  
- All CAs SHALL publish CRLs.  On-line CAs SHALL update and reissue CRLs at least once every 24 hours and the value of the nextUpdate field MUST NOT be more than seven days beyond the value of the thisUpdate field

For the status of Subordinate CA Certificates:
- The CA SHALL update and reissue CRLs at least (i) once every 31 days and (ii) within 24 hours after revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate, and the value of the nextUpdate field SHALL NOT be more than 32 days beyond the value of the thisUpdate field.

### 4.9.8 Maximum latency for CRLs
CRLs shall be published within 4 hours of generation. Furthermore, each CRL shall be published no later than the time specified in the nextUpdate field of the previously issued CRL for same scope.

### 4.9.9 On-line revocation/status checking availability
OCSP responses SHALL conform to RFC6960 and/or RFC5019. OCSP responses SHALL either:

1. Be signed by the CA that issued the Certificates whose revocation status is being checked, or
2. Be signed by an OCSP Responder whose Certificate is signed by the CA that issued the Certificate whose
revocation status is being checked.

In the latter case, the OCSP signing Certificate MUST contain an extension of type id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck, as
defined by RFC6960.

### 4.9.10 On-line revocation checking requirements
The CA SHALL support an OCSP capability using the GET method for Certificates issued in accordance with these Requirements.

For the status of Subscriber Certificates:

- The OCSP Responder SHALL update the information used to respond to requests within 4 hours of a new CRL being issued by the CA for all requests. OCSP responses from this service SHALL have a maximum expiration time of ten (10) days

For the status of Subordinate CA Certificates:

- The CA SHALL update information provided via an Online Certificate Status Protocol at least (i) every 31 days and (ii) within 24 hours after revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate.

If the OCSP responder receives a request for status of a certificate that has not been issued, then the responder SHALL NOT respond with a "good" status. The CA SHALL monitor the responder for such requests as part of its security response procedures.

OCSP responders for CAs which are not Technically Constrained in line with Section 7.1.5 MUST NOT respond with a "good" status for such certificates.

### 4.9.11 Other forms of revocation advertisements available
If the Subscriber Certificate is for a high-traffic FQDN, the CA MAY rely on stapling, in accordance with [RFC4366], to distribute its OCSP responses. In this case, the CA SHALL ensure that the Subscriber "staples" the OCSP response for the Certificate in its TLS handshake. The CA SHALL enforce this requirement on the Subscriber either contractually, through the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use, or by technical review measures implemented by the CA.

### 4.9.12 Special requirements re key compromise
See Section 4.9.1.
When a CA certificate is revoked a CRL SHALL be issued within 24 hours of notification.

1. Protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes;
2. Protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes;
3. Protect against unauthorized or unlawful access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of any Certificate Data or Certificate Management Processes;
4. Protect against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, any Certificate Data or Certificate Management Processes; and
5. Comply with all other security requirements applicable to the CA by law.

The Certificate Management Process SHALL include:

1. physical security and environmental controls;
2. system integrity controls, including configuration management, integrity maintenance of trusted code, and malware detection/prevention;
3. network security and firewall management, including port restrictions and IP address filtering;
4. user management, separate trusted-role assignments, education, awareness, and training; and
5. logical access controls, activity logging, and inactivity time-outs to provide individual accountability.

The CA's security program SHALL include an annual Risk Assessment that:

1. Identifies foreseeable internal and external threats that could result in unauthorized access, disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction of any Certificate Data or Certificate Management Processes;
2. Assesses the likelihood and potential damage of these threats, taking into consideration the sensitivity of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes; and
3. Assesses the sufficiency of the policies, procedures, information systems, technology, and other arrangements that the CA has in place to counter such threats.

Based on the Risk Assessment, the CA SHALL develop, implement, and maintain a security plan consisting of security procedures, measures, and products designed to achieve the objectives set forth above and to manage and control the risks identified during the Risk Assessment, commensurate with the sensitivity of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes. The security plan SHALL include administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes. The security plan SHALL also take into account then-available technology and the cost of implementing the specific measures, and SHALL implement a reasonable level of security appropriate to the harm that might result from a breach of security and the nature of the data to be protected.

## 5.1 PHYSICAL SECURITY CONTROLS
CA equipment SHALL be protected from unauthorized access while the cryptographic module is installed and activated.  The CA SHALL implement physical access controls to reduce the risk of equipment tampering even when the cryptographic module is not installed and activated.  CA cryptographic tokens SHALL be protected against theft, loss, and unauthorized use.  

All the physical control requirements specified below apply equally to the Root CA and Subordinate CAs, and any remote workstations used to administer the CAs, except where specifically noted.

### 5.1.1 Site location and construction
The location and construction of the facility housing the CA equipment, as well as sites housing remote workstations used to administer the CAs, SHALL be consistent with facilities used to house high-value, sensitive information.  The site location and construction, when combined with other physical security protection mechanisms such as guards, high security locks, and intrusion sensors, SHALL provide robust protection against unauthorized access to the CA equipment and records.

### 5.1.2 Physical access
At a minimum, the physical access controls for CA equipment and Certificate Status Authority (CSA) equipment, as well as remote workstations used to administer the CAs, SHALL:

- Ensure that no unauthorized access to the hardware is permitted.
- Ensure that all removable media and paper containing sensitive plain-text information is stored in secure containers.
- Be manually or electronically monitored for unauthorized intrusion at all times.
- Ensure an access log is maintained and inspected periodically.
- Require two-person physical access control to both the cryptographic module and computer systems.  

When not in use, removable cryptographic modules, activation information used to access or enable cryptographic modules, and CA equipment SHALL be placed in secure containers.  Activation data SHALL be either memorized or recorded and stored in a manner commensurate with the security afforded the cryptographic module, and SHALL not be stored with the cryptographic module or removable hardware associated with remote workstations used to administer the CA.  

A security check of the facility housing the CA equipment or remote workstations used to administer the CAs SHALL occur if the facility is to be left unattended.  At a minimum, the check SHALL verify the following:  

- The equipment is in a state appropriate to the current mode of operation (e.g., that cryptographic modules are in place when “open,” and secured when “closed,” and for the CA, that all equipment other than the repository is shut down).
- Any security containers are properly secured.
- Physical security systems (e.g., door locks, vent covers) are functioning properly.
- The area is secured against unauthorized access.

A person or group of persons SHALL be made explicitly responsible for making such checks.  When a group of persons is responsible, a log identifying the person performing a check at each instance SHALL be maintained.  If the facility is not continuously attended, the last person to depart SHALL initial a sign-out sheet that indicates the date and time and asserts that all necessary physical protection mechanisms are in place and activated.

### 5.1.3 Power and air conditioning
The CA SHALL have backup capability sufficient to lock out input, finish any pending actions, and record the state of the equipment automatically before lack of power or air conditioning causes a shutdown.  

The repositories (containing CA certificates and CRLs) SHALL be provided with uninterrupted power sufficient for a minimum of 6 hours operation in the absence of commercial power, to maintain availability and avoid denial of service.

### 5.1.4 Water exposures
CA equipment SHALL be installed such that it is not in danger of exposure to water.

### 5.1.5 Fire prevention and protection
No Stipulation

### 5.1.6 Media storage
Media SHALL be stored so as to protect them from accidental damage (e.g., water, fire, or electromagnetic) and unauthorized physical access.

### 5.1.7 Waste disposal
Sensitive media and documentation that are no longer needed for operations SHALL be destroyed in a secure manner.  For example, sensitive paper documentation SHALL be shredded, burned, or otherwise rendered unrecoverable.

### 5.1.8 Off-site backup
Full system backups sufficient to recover from system failure SHALL be made on a periodic schedule.  Backups are to be performed and stored off-site not less than once per week.  At least one full backup copy SHALL be stored at an off-site location (separate from CA equipment).  Only the latest full backup need be retained.  The backup SHALL be stored at a site with physical and procedural controls commensurate to that of the operational CA.

## 5.2 Procedural controls

### 5.2.1 Trusted roles
A trusted role is one whose incumbent performs functions that can introduce security problems if not carried out properly, whether accidentally or maliciously.

The requirements of this policy are defined in terms of four roles. Each CA shall maintain lists, including names, contact information, and copies of appointment memoranda of those who act in these trusted roles, and shall make them available during compliance audits. The CA will make this information a part of the permanent records of the CA. However, the CA shall not maintain personnel or investigative records requiring protection under the Privacy Act.

1.	Administrator - authorized to install, configure, and maintain the CA; establish and maintain accounts; configure profiles and audit parameters; and generate component keys.
2.	Officer - authorized to request or approve certificates or certificate revocations, and perform the Validation Specialist functions for quarterly reviews of issued certificates
3.	Auditor – authorized to review, maintain, and archive audit logs.
4.	Operator – authorized to perform system backup and recovery.

These four roles are employed at the CA.  Separation of duties SHALL comply with 5.2.4, and requirements for two-person control with 5.2.2, regardless of the titles and numbers of Trusted Roles.

## 5.4 Audit logging procedures

### 5.4.1 Types of events recorded
The CA SHALL record details of the actions taken to process a certificate request and to issue a Certificate, including all information generated and documentation received in connection with the certificate request; the time and date; and the personnel involved. The CA SHALL make these records available to its Qualified Auditor as proof of the CA's compliance with these Requirements.

The CA SHALL record at least the following events:

1. CA key lifecycle management events, including:

  a. Key generation, backup, storage, recovery, archival, and destruction; and
  b. Cryptographic device lifecycle management events.

2. CA and Subscriber Certificate lifecycle management events, including:

Such reviews involve verifying that the log has not been tampered with and then briefly inspecting all log entries, with a more thorough investigation of any alerts or irregularities in the logs.  A statistically significant portion of the security audit data generated by the CA since the last review SHALL be examined.  This amount will be described in the CPS.

All significant events SHALL be explained in an audit log summary.  Actions taken as a result of these reviews SHALL be documented.

### 5.4.3 Retention Period for Audit Logs
Audit logs SHALL be retained on-site until reviewed, in addition to being archived as described in section 5.5.  The individual who removes audit logs from the CA system SHALL be an official different from the individuals who, in combination, command the CA signature key.

The CA SHALL retain any audit logs generated for at least seven years. The CA SHALL make these audit logs available to its Qualified Auditor upon request.

### 5.4.4 Protection of Audit Log
The CA SHALL ensure audit logs are unalterable or maintain an integrity mechanism to identify any changes.

The security audit data SHALL not be open for reading or modification by any human, or by any automated process, other than those that perform security audit processing.  CA system configuration and procedures must be implemented together to ensure that only authorized people archive or delete security audit data.  Procedures must be implemented to protect archived data from deletion or destruction before the end of the security audit data retention period (note that deletion requires modification access).  Security audit data SHALL be moved to a safe, secure storage location separate from the location where the data was generated.

### 5.4.5 Audit Log Backup Procedures
Audit logs and audit summaries SHALL be backed up at least monthly.  A copy of the audit log SHALL be sent off-site on a monthly basis.

### 5.4.6 Audit Log Accumulation System (internal vs. external)
The audit log collection system may or may not be external to the CA system.  Automated audit processes SHALL be invoked at system or application startup, and cease only at system or application shutdown.  Audit collection systems SHALL be configured such that security audit data is protected against loss (e.g., overwriting or overflow of automated log files).  Should it become apparent that an automated audit system has failed, and the integrity of the system or confidentiality of the information protected by the system is at risk, operations SHALL be suspended until the problem has been remedied.

### 5.4.7 Notification to event-causing subject
There is no requirement to notify a subject that an event was audited.  Real-time alerts are neither required nor prohibited by this policy.

### 5.5.2 Retention period for archive
The CA SHALL retain all documentation relating to certificate requests and the verification thereof, and all Certificates and revocation thereof, for a minimum of 10 years and 6 months without any loss of data after any Certificate based on that documentation ceases to be valid.

### 5.5.3 Protection of archive
No unauthorized user SHALL be permitted to write to, modify, or delete the archive.  For the CA, archived records may be moved to another medium.  The contents of the archive SHALL not be released except in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (as amended) and applicable Agency policies.  Records of individual transactions may be released upon request of any subscribers involved in the transaction or their legally recognized agents.  Archive media SHALL be stored in a safe, secure storage facility separate from the CA.

If the original media cannot retain the data for the required period, a mechanism to periodically transfer the archived data to new media SHALL be defined by the archive site.

Alternatively, a CA operating under this policy may retain data using whatever procedures have been approved by NARA for that category of documents.  Applications required to process the archive data SHALL be maintained for a period that equals or exceeds the archive requirements for the data.

### 5.5.4 Archive backup procedures
No Stipulation

### 5.5.5 Requirements for time-stamping of records
CA archive records SHALL be automatically time-stamped as they are created.  The system clocks used for time-stamping SHALL be maintained in synchrony with an authoritative time standard.

Archive data may be collected in any expedient manner.

### 5.5.7 Procedures to obtain and verify archive information
Procedures, detailing how to create, verify, package, transmit, and store the CA archive information, SHALL be published in the CPS.

## 5.6 Key changeover
To minimize risk from compromise of a CA’s private signing key, that key may be changed often.  From that time on, only the new key will be used to sign CA and subscriber certificates.  If the old private key is used to sign OCSP responder certificates or CRLs that cover certificates signed with that key, the old key must be retained and protected.  

After a CA performs a Key Changeover, the CA may continue to issue CRLs with the old key until all certificates signed with that key have expired.  

When a CA updates its private signature key and thus generates a new public key, the CA SHALL notify the FPKI Policy Authority and subscribers of the change.  

## 5.7 Compromise and disaster recovery

### 5.7.1 Incident and compromise handling procedures
CA organizations shall have an Incident Response Plan and a Disaster Recovery Plan.

The CA SHALL document a business continuity and disaster recovery procedures designed to notify and reasonably protect Application Software Suppliers, Subscribers, and Relying Parties in the event of a disaster, security compromise, or business failure. The CA is not required to publicly disclose its business continuity plans but SHALL make its business continuity plan and security plans available to the CA's auditors upon request. The CA SHALL annually test, review, and update these procedures.

The business continuity plan MUST include:

1. The conditions for activating the plan,

- Specify a due date for the CA to submit a final security incident report.

The FPKIPA shall notify the CA, in writing, of its intentions in response to the security incident seven (7) days prior to the action by the FPKIPA except under exceptional circumstances (as defined in the glossary) where the FPKIPA will make reasonable efforts to communicate with the CA prior to taking action. The  CA may propose an alternate course of action and the FPKIPA may consider reasonable alternatives but reserves the right to reject any proposed course of action not in the government’s best interest.

**Note**: The FPKIPA will follow individual Application Trusted Root Program requirements to report security concerns.


### 5.7.2 Recovery Procedures if Computing resources, software, and/or data are corrupted
When computing resources, software, and/or data are corrupted, CAs operating under this policy SHALL respond as follows:

- Before returning to operation, ensure that the system’s integrity has been restored.
-	If the CA signature keys are not destroyed, CA operation SHALL be reestablished, giving priority to the ability to generate certificate status information within the CRL issuance schedule.
- If the CA signature keys are destroyed, CA operation SHALL be reestablished as quickly as possible, giving priority to the generation of a new CA key pair.

### 5.7.3 Recovery Procedures after Key Compromise
In the event of a CA private key compromise, the following operations MUST be performed.

- The FPKI Policy Authority SHALL be immediately informed, as well as any superior CAs and any entities known to be distributing the CA certificate.
-	The CA MUST generate new keys.
- The superior CA must be revoke the subordinate CA certificate within seven (7) days.
- All subscriber certificates MUST be revoked within twenty-four (24) hours.

If the CA distributed the private key in a Trusted Certificate, the CA SHALL perform the following operations:  

-	Generate a new Trusted Certificate.
-	Securely distribute the new Trusted Certificate
-	Initiate procedures to notify subscribers of the compromise.

Subscriber certificates may be renewed automatically by the CA under the new key pair, or the CA may require subscribers to repeat the initial certificate application process.  

### 5.7.4 Business continuity capabilities after a disaster
For the Root CA, recovery procedures SHALL be in place to reconstitute the CA within six (6) hours of failure.

All other CAs operating under this policy SHALL have recovery procedures in place to reconstitute the CA within 72 hours of failure.

In the case of a disaster whereby the CA installation is physically damaged and all copies of the CA signature key are destroyed as a result, the FPKI Policy Authority SHALL be notified at the earliest feasible time, and the FPKI Policy Authority SHALL take whatever action it deems appropriate.

Relying parties may decide of their own volition whether to continue to use certificates signed with the destroyed private key pending reestablishment of CA operation with new certificates.

## 5.8 CA or RA termination
This section does not apply to CAs that have ceased issuing new certificates but are continuing to issue CRLs until all certificates have expired.  Such CAs are required to continue to conform with all relevant aspects of this policy (e.g., audit logging and archives).

When a CA operating under this policy terminates operations before all certificates have expired, the CA signing keys SHALL be surrendered to the FPKI Policy Authority.

Any issued certificates that have not expired, SHALL be revoked and a final long term CRL with a nextUpdate time past the validity period of all issued certificates SHALL be generated.  This final CRL SHALL be available for all relying parties until the validity period of all issued certificates has passed.  Once the last CRL has been issued, the private signing key(s) of the CA to be terminated will be destroyed.

Prior to CA termination, the CA SHALL provide archived data to an archive facility.  As soon as possible, the CA will advise all other organizations to which it has issued certificates of its termination.

# 6. TECHNICAL SECURITY CONTROLS

## 6.1 Key pair generation and installation

### 6.1.1 Key pair generation

#### 6.1.1.1 CA Key Pair Generation
In all cases, the CA SHALL:

1. prepare and follow a Key Generation Script,
2. have a Qualified Auditor witness the CA Key Pair generation process or record a video of the entire CA Key Pair generation process, and
3. have a Qualified Auditor issue a report opining that the CA followed its key ceremony during its Key and Certificate generation process and the controls used to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the Key Pair.

In all cases, the CA SHALL:

1. Generate the CA keys in a physically secured environment as described in the CA's Certification Practice Statement;
2. Generate the CA keys using personnel in Trusted Roles under the principles of multiple person control and split knowledge;
3. Generate the CA keys within cryptographic modules that meet or exceed FIPS 140 Level 3 validation;
4. Log its CA key generation activities;
5. Maintain effective controls to provide reasonable assurance that the Private Key was generated and protected in conformance with the procedures described in the Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement and its Key Generation Script.

The documentation of the procedure must be detailed enough to show that appropriate role separation was used and the CA key pair generation must create a verifiable audit trail that the security requirements for procedures were followed.

#### 6.1.1.2 RA Key Pair Generation
RAs SHALL NOT generate key pairs.

#### 6.1.1.3 Subscriber Key Pair Generation
The CA SHALL reject a certificate request if the requested Public Key does not meet the requirements set forth in Sections 6.1.5 and 6.1.6 or if it has a known weak Private Key (such as a Debian weak key, see <http://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys>).

### 6.1.2 Private key delivery to subscriber
Parties other than the Subscriber SHALL NOT archive the Subscriber Private Key without authorization by the Subscriber.

Subscribers SHALL generate their own keys in compliance with sections 6.1.5 and 6.1.6.

If the CA or any of its designated RAs become aware that a Subscriber's Private Key has been communicated to an unauthorized person or an organization not affiliated with the Subscriber, then the CA SHALL revoke all certificates that include the Public Key corresponding to the communicated Private Key.

### 6.1.3 Public key delivery to certificate issuer

The public key and the subscriber’s identity must be delivered securely to the CA for certificate issuance. The delivery mechanism shall bind the subscriber’s verified identity to the public key. If cryptography is used to achieve this binding, it must be at least as strong as the CA keys used to sign the certificate.

### 6.1.4 CA public key delivery to relying parties

When a Subordinate CA updates its signature key pair, the CA shall distribute the new public key in a secure fashion.

The Root CA certificate(s) shall be conveyed to relying parties in a secure fashion to preclude substitution attacks. Acceptable methods for self-signed Root CA certificate delivery are:
- Loading a self-signed certificate onto tokens delivered to relying parties via secure mechanisms;
- Secure distribution of self-signed certificates through secure out-of-band mechanisms;
- Comparison of the hash of the self-signed certificate against a hash value made available via authenticated out-of-band sources (note that hashes posted in-band along with the certificate are not acceptable as an authentication mechanism)

### 6.1.5 Key sizes

4. Be licensed as a CA in each jurisdiction where it operates, if licensing is required by the law of such jurisdiction for the issuance of Certificates.

## 8.1 Frequency or circumstances of assessment
The Certification Authorities (X.509v3 basicConstraints extension, with the cA boolean set to true) operated under this Certificate Policy are Technically Constrained in line with section 7.1.5.  They are audited in line with section 8.7.

The period during which the CA issues Certificates SHALL be divided into an unbroken sequence of audit periods.
An audit period MUST NOT exceed one year in duration.

Before issuing Publicly-Trusted Certificates, any CA SHALL successfully complete a point-in-time readiness assessment performed in accordance with applicable standards under one of the audit schemes listed in Section 8.1. The point-in-time readiness assessment SHALL be completed no earlier than twelve (12) months prior to issuing Publicly-Trusted Certificates and SHALL be followed by a complete audit under such scheme within ninety (90) days of issuing the first Publicly-Trusted Certificate

## 8.2 Identity/qualifications of assessor
The CA's audit SHALL be performed by a Qualified Auditor. A Qualified Auditor means a natural person, Legal Entity, or group of natural persons or Legal Entities that collectively possess the following qualifications and skills:

1. Independence from the subject of the audit;
2. The ability to conduct an audit that addresses the criteria specified in an Eligible Audit Scheme (see Section 8.1);

An example of the latter situation may be an Federal agency Inspector General. To insure independence and objectivity, the compliance auditor may not have served the entity in developing or maintaining the entity’s CA Facility or certification practices statement. The FPKI Policy Authority shall determine whether a compliance auditor meets this requirement.

The operating Agency and Management Authority of each CA is responsible for identifying and engaging a qualified auditor.

## 8.4 Topics covered by assessment
The CA SHALL undergo an audit in accordance with one of the following schemes:

1. WebTrust for Certification Authorities v2.0;
2. A national scheme that audits conformance to ETSI TS 102 042 / ETSI EN 319 411-1; or

•	The compliance auditor shall note the discrepancy;
•	The compliance auditor shall notify the responsible party promptly; and
•	The party responsible for correcting the discrepancy will propose a remedy, including expected time for completion, to the FPKI Policy Authority.

Depending upon the nature and severity of the discrepancy, and how quickly it can be corrected, the FPKI Policy Authority may decide to temporarily halt operation of the CA or RA, to revoke a certificate issued to the CA or RA, or take other actions it deems appropriate. A compliance audit may be required to confirm the implementation and effectiveness of the remedy.


## 8.6 Communication of results
The Audit Report SHALL state explicitly that it covers the relevant systems and processes used in the issuance of all Certificates that assert one or more of the policy identifiers listed in Section 7.1.6.1. The CA SHALL make the Audit Report publicly available. The CA is not required to make publicly available any general audit findings that do not impact the overall audit opinion.  The CA SHOULD make its Audit Report publicly available no later than three months after the end of the audit period. In the event of a delay greater than three months, and if so requested by an Application Software Supplier, the CA SHALL provide an explanatory letter signed by the Qualified Auditor.

## 8.7 Self-Audits
During the period in which the CA issues Certificates, the CA SHALL monitor adherence to its Certificate Policy, Certification Practice Statement and these Requirements and strictly control its service quality by performing self audits on at least a quarterly basis against a randomly selected sample of the greater of one certificate or at least three percent of the Certificates issued by it during the period commencing immediately after the previous self-audit sample was taken.

During the period in which a Technically Constrained Subordinate CA issues Certificates, the CA which signed the Subordinate CA SHALL monitor adherence to the this Certificate Policy and the Subordinate CA's Certification Practice Statement.

### 9.6.2 RA representations and warranties
No stipulation.

### 9.6.3 Subscriber representations and warranties
The CA SHALL require, as part of the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use, that the Applicant make the commitments and warranties in this section for the benefit of the CA and the Certificate Beneficiaries.

Prior to the issuance of a Certificate, the CA SHALL obtain, for the express benefit of the CA and the Certificate Beneficiaries, either:

1. The Applicant's agreement to the Subscriber Agreement with the CA, or
2. The Applicant's acknowledgement of the Terms of Use.

The CA SHALL implement a process to ensure that each Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use is legally enforceable against the Applicant. In either case, the Agreement MUST apply to the Certificate to be issued pursuant to the certificate request. The CA MAY use an electronic or "click-through" Agreement provided that the CA has determined that such agreements are legally enforceable. A separate Agreement MAY be used for each certificate request, or a single Agreement MAY be used to cover multiple future certificate requests and the resulting Certificates, so long as each Certificate that the CA issues to the Applicant is clearly covered by that Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use.

The Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use MUST contain provisions imposing on the Applicant itself (or made by the Applicant on behalf of its principal or agent under a subcontractor or hosting service relationship) the following obligations and warranties:

1. **Accuracy of Information**: An obligation and warranty to provide accurate and complete information at all times to the CA, both in the certificate request and as otherwise requested by the CA in connection with the issuance of the Certificate(s) to be supplied by the CA;

7. **Responsiveness**: An obligation to respond to the CA's instructions concerning Key Compromise or Certificate misuse within a specified time period.
8. **Acknowledgment and Acceptance**: An acknowledgment and acceptance that the CA is entitled to revoke the certificate immediately if the Applicant were to violate the terms of the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use or if the CA discovers that the Certificate is being used to enable criminal activities such as phishing attacks, fraud, or the distribution of malware.

### 9.6.4 Relying party representations and warranties

### 9.6.5 Representations and warranties of other participants

## 9.7 Disclaimers of warranties

## 9.8 Limitations of liability
For delegated tasks, the CA and any Delegated Third Party MAY allocate liability between themselves contractually as they determine, but the CA SHALL remain fully responsible for the performance of all parties in accordance with these Requirements, as if the tasks had not been delegated.

If the CA has issued and managed the Certificate in compliance with these Requirements and its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, the CA MAY disclaim liability to the Certificate Beneficiaries or any other third parties for any losses suffered as a result of use or reliance on such Certificate beyond those specified in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. If the CA has not issued or managed the Certificate in compliance with these Requirements and its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, the CA MAY seek to limit its liability to the Subscriber and to Relying Parties, regardless of the cause of action or legal theory involved, for any and all claims, losses or damages suffered as a result of the use or reliance on such Certificate by any appropriate means that the CA desires. If the CA chooses to limit its liability for Certificates that are not issued or managed in compliance with these Requirements or its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, then the CA SHALL include the limitations on liability in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement.

## 9.9 Indemnities

Notwithstanding any limitations on its liability to Subscribers and Relying Parties, the CA understands and acknowledges that the Application Software Suppliers who have a Root Certificate distribution agreement in place with the Root CA do not assume any obligation or potential liability of the CA under these Requirements or that otherwise might exist because of the issuance or maintenance of Certificates or reliance thereon by Relying Parties or others. Thus, except in the case where the CA is a government entity, the CA SHALL defend, indemnify, and hold harmless each Application Software Supplier for any and all claims, damages, and losses suffered by such Application Software Supplier related to a Certificate issued by the CA, regardless of the cause of action or legal theory involved. This does not apply, however, to any claim, damages, or loss suffered by such Application Software Supplier related to a Certificate issued by the CA where such claim, damage, or loss was directly caused by such Application Software Supplier's software displaying as not trustworthy a Certificate that is still valid, or displaying as trustworthy: (1) a Certificate that has expired, or (2) a Certificate that has been revoked (but only in cases where the revocation status is currently available from the CA online, and the application software either failed to check such status or ignored an indication of revoked status).

In the event of a conflict between these Requirements and a law, regulation or government order (hereinafter 'Law') of any jurisdiction in which a CA operates or issues certificates, a CA MAY modify any conflicting requirement to the minimum extent necessary to make the requirement valid and legal in the jurisdiction. This applies only to operations or certificate issuances that are subject to that Law. In such event, the CA SHALL immediately (and prior to issuing a certificate under the modified requirement) include in Section 9.16.3 of the CA's CPS a detailed reference to the Law requiring a modification of these Requirements under this section, and the specific modification to these Requirements implemented by the CA.

The CA MUST also (prior to issuing a certificate under the modified requirement) notify the CA/Browser Forum of the relevant information newly added to its CPS by sending a message to questions@cabforum.org and receiving confirmation that it has been posted to the Public Mailing List and is indexed in the Public Mail Archives available at https://cabforum.org/pipermail/public/ (or such other email addresses and links as the Forum may designate), so that the CA/Browser Forum may consider possible revisions to these Requirements accordingly.

Any modification to CA practice enabled under this section MUST be discontinued if and when the Law no longer applies, or these Requirements are modified to make it possible to comply with both them and the Law simultaneously. An appropriate change in practice, modification to the CA's CPS and a notice to the CA/Browser Forum, as outlined above, MUST be made within 90 days.
